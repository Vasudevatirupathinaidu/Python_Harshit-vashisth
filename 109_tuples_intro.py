# tuple data structure
# tuple can store any data type
# most important tuples are immutable, once tuple is created you can't update data inside tuple

example = ('one', 'two', 'three')
# no append, no insert, no pop, no remove

# methods
# count, index
print(example.count('one'))
print(example.index('two'))
